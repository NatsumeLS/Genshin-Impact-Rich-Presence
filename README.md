> - Windows only
> - Game text language must be English.
> - Works best when traveling from a place to another instead of teleporting to it since it gives time for the app to read the place title you are in best
> - Supported resolutions: 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 2560x1080 (Ultrawide) fullscreen
> - Party must have 4 members, works for Single Player mode only (TODO: Alternate party setup support)

This Discord Rich Presence doesn't tamper with Genshin Impact game files in any way. It works by scanning text in screen captures.

## Setup guide

### 0. Install Python

You will need Python 3.8 or newer (latest Python version is recommended). Install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 1. Update NVIDIA Game Ready Driver

Update to the latest NVIDIA game ready graphics driver that supports CUDA 11.8 (version > 525).

### 2. Setup image capture coordinates

Modify [CONFIG.py](CONFIG.py) to configure coordinates of specific game text as shown below.

If you're running the game in fullscreen with a standard 16:9 aspect ratio, you can just set the `GAME_RESOLUTION` variable to your screen resolution (e.g. `GAME_RESOLUTION = 1080` for 1920x1080, 1080p).

ðŸŸ  If you're using DLDSR/DLSS/NVIDIA Image Sharpening or any otherGPU configuration that performs image upscaling or oversampling (not counting the built-in AMD FSR2 anti-aliasing mode), you'll need to set this to the final output resolution that your screen will display. E.g. 75% resolution with NVIDIA Image Sharpening will still result in an image with the same resolution as your monitor, so you should use the monitor resolution instead of the in-game resolution.

The **`GAME_RESOLUTION` setting only works if you're running the game in fullscreen at a 16:9 aspect ratio.** Otherwise, you'll need to set `GAME_RESOLUTION = 0` and follow [this guide to configure the coordinates manually.](configure%20coordinates.md)

### 3. Configure settings in [CONFIG.py](CONFIG.py)

- Configure `USERNAME` to match your Genshin username (must be exactly the same)
- Set `MC_AETHER = True` if Aether is MC, `MC_AETHER = False` if Lumine is MC.
- (SPOILER) Set `WANDERER_NAME` to match custom Wanderer's name in lowercase.

### 4. [Optional] Test if image capture works

Run [test_imagegrab.py](test_imagegrab.py) in Python using cmd/terminal/powershell or otherwise.

```bat
py test_imagegrab.py
```

- Alt+tab to Genshin and leave it running for about 10s. Then, change characters and visit a few places (make sure the location text pops up)
- Check the terminal to make sure everything works.
- If you have two monitors, you can enable the capture display windows by setting `SHOW_CHARACTERS = True`, `SHOW_LOC = True` etc... in [test_imagegrab.py](test_imagegrab.py). This way, you can monitor image captures without needing to alt+tab.

### 5. Start Discord Rich Presence

Double click [run.bat](run.bat) to start Discord Rich Presence for Genshin Impact.
