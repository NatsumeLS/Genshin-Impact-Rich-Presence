> - Windows only
> - Game text language must be English.
> - Works best when traveling from a place to another instead of teleporting to it since it gives time for the app to read the place title you are in best
> - Supported resolutions: 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 2560x1080 (Ultrawide) fullscreen
> - Party must have 4 members, works for Single Player mode only (TODO: Alternate party setup support)

This Discord Rich Presence doesn't tamper with Genshin Impact game files in any way. It works by scanning text in screen captures.

## Setup guide

### 1. Download project, install Python, update NVIDIA driver

You will need **Python 3.8 or newer** (latest Python version is recommended). Install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Download the latest project code using git:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/euwbah/Genshin-Impact-Rich-Presence.git
```

Alternatively, [download code as zip](https://github.com/euwbah/Genshin-Impact-Rich-Presence/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Check NVIDIA GeForce Experience for updates. Game Ready graphics driver version >525 is required for CUDA 11.8 support.

### 2. Set game resolution/image capture coordinates

Edit these settings in [CONFIG.py](CONFIG.py):

If you're running the game in fullscreen with a standard 16:9 aspect ratio, set the `GAME_RESOLUTION` variable to your screen resolution (e.g. use `GAME_RESOLUTION = 1080` for 1920x1080, 1080p).

üü† If you're using DLDSR/DLSS/NVIDIA Image Sharpening or any other GPU configuration that performs image upscaling or oversampling (not counting the built-in AMD FSR2 anti-aliasing mode), you'll need to set this to the final output resolution that your screen will display. E.g. 75% resolution with NVIDIA Image Sharpening will still result in an image with the same resolution as your monitor, so you should use the monitor resolution instead of the in-game resolution.

‚ö†Ô∏è The **`GAME_RESOLUTION` setting only works if you're running the game in fullscreen at a 16:9 aspect ratio.** Otherwise, you'll need to set `GAME_RESOLUTION = 0` and follow [this guide to configure the coordinates manually.](configure%20coordinates.md)

### 3. Configure settings in [CONFIG.py](CONFIG.py)

- Configure `USERNAME` to match your Genshin username (must be exactly the same)
- Set `MC_AETHER = True` if Aether is MC, `MC_AETHER = False` if Lumine is MC.
- (SPOILER) Set `WANDERER_NAME` to match custom Wanderer's name in lowercase.

### 4. [Optional] Test if image capture works

Run [test_imagegrab.py](test_imagegrab.py) in Python using cmd/terminal/powershell or otherwise.

```bat
py test_imagegrab.py
```

- Alt+tab to Genshin and leave it running for about 10s. Then, change characters and visit a few places (make sure the location text pops up)
- Check the terminal to make sure everything works.
- If you have two monitors, you can enable the capture display windows by setting `SHOW_CHARACTERS = True`, `SHOW_LOC = True` etc... in [test_imagegrab.py](test_imagegrab.py). This way, you can monitor image captures without needing to alt+tab.

### 5. Start Discord Rich Presence

Double click [run.bat](run.bat) to start Discord Rich Presence for Genshin Impact. You can create an application/desktop shortcut for run.bat to make it easier to start.

## Development

To set up the project for development/testing.

```bat
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use an IDE/editor (like VSCode) with Python venv support so you don't have to activate the venv manually every time.

`py main.py` runs the program.
